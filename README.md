# Breakout Game — CSC222 Mini Project

A classic Breakout-style game implemented in Python using Pygame.  
Created as part of the CSC222 Game Development mini-project (2024 Edition).

## 🎮 Features
- Improved ball collision response (side-aware brick bounce + paddle angle control)
- Multiple level layouts with progression and increasing difficulty
- Difficulty presets (Easy / Normal / Hard) with different lives/speed/drop-rate balance
- Meta progression: XP + currency rewards per run
- Shop/loadout system for unlockables (paddle skins, ball trails, backgrounds)
- Brick variants: normal, strong (2 hits), unbreakable, explosive (AOE break)
- Extra brick modifiers: shielded, teleport, regen, timed bombs
- Powerups: extra life, bigger paddle, multiball, laser, slow-motion, sticky paddle, shield
- Hazard drops: smaller paddle and faster ball
- Combo scoring multiplier + high-score persistence (`high_score.json`)
- High score now autosaves immediately when beaten
- Menu + pause + game-over states, volume controls, alternative movement keys
- Dedicated Settings screen (master/SFX/music levels, controls preset, fullscreen, BGM)
- Dedicated Settings screen (master/SFX/music levels, controls preset, fullscreen, BGM, ghost replay toggle)
- Mouse-clickable menu/settings/shop/run-summary controls
- Local leaderboard (top 10) per mode
- Run summary screen with rewards and performance metrics
- Campaign mode with a proper completion state
- Daily Challenge mode with seeded layouts (same seed for the day)
- Daily share-code input so runs can be replayed with the same seed
- Daily ghost replay: your best run per daily seed is recorded and shown as a live ghost
- Boss waves every 3 levels (moving boss + hazard drops + boss HP bar)
- Boss personalities per tier (Sentinel/Trickster/Berserker) with unique attack rotations
- Round start countdown + contextual control hints
- Menu now shows BGM status with toggle and playback fallback
- Visual polish: layered particles, curved screen shake, impact flash, level intro flash, transition fade
- Sound effects with optional looping music support (`assets/sounds/bgm.wav` if provided)
- Persistent player profile (`player_profile.json`): settings + lifetime stats
- Code split into helper modules (`config.py`, `audio.py`, `game_state.py`, `ui.py`, `modes/`)
- Responsive rendering with resize/fullscreen scaling and letterboxing
